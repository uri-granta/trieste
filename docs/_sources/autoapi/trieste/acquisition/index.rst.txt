:mod:`trieste.acquisition`
==========================

.. py:module:: trieste.acquisition

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   The acquisition process aims to find the optimal point(s) at which to next evaluate the objective
   function, with the aim of minimising it. The functionality in this package implements that process.
   It typically uses the current observations of the objective function, or a posterior over those
   observations.

   In this library, the acquisition rule is the central object of the API, while acquisition functions
   are supplementary. This is because some acquisition rules, such as Thompson sampling,
   do not require an acquisition function. This contrasts with other libraries which may consider
   the acquisition function as the central component of this process and assume Efficient Global
   Optimization (EGO) for the acquisition rule.

   This package contains acquisition rules, as implementations of
   :class:`~trieste.acquisition.rule.AcquisitionRule`, and acquisition functions. It also contains
   :class:`AcquisitionFunctionBuilder`\ s which provide a common interface for the rules to build
   acquisition functions.

   Acquisition rules in this library that use acquisition functions, such as
   :class:`EfficientGlobalOptimization`, *maximize* these functions. This defines the sign the
   acquisition function should take. Additionally, acquisition functions and builders in this library
   are designed to minimize the objective function. For example, we do not provide an implementation of
   UCB.

.. class:: Product(*builders: trieste.acquisition.function.AcquisitionFunctionBuilder)


   Bases: :py:obj:`Reducer`

   :class:`Reducer` whose resulting acquisition function returns the element-wise product of the
   outputs of constituent acquisition functions.

   :param \*builders: Acquisition function builders. At least one must be provided.
   :raise `~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError`: If no builders are specified.

   .. method:: _reduce(self, inputs: collections.abc.Sequence[trieste.type.TensorType]) -> trieste.type.TensorType

      :param inputs: The outputs of each acquisition function.
      :return: The element-wise product of the ``inputs``.



.. class:: Reducer(*builders: trieste.acquisition.function.AcquisitionFunctionBuilder)


   Bases: :py:obj:`trieste.acquisition.function.AcquisitionFunctionBuilder`

   A :class:`Reducer` builds an :const:`~trieste.acquisition.AcquisitionFunction` whose output is
   calculated from the outputs of a number of other
   :const:`~trieste.acquisition.AcquisitionFunction`\ s. How these outputs are composed is defined
   by the method :meth:`_reduce`.

   :param \*builders: Acquisition function builders. At least one must be provided.
   :raise `~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError`: If no builders are specified.

   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, datasets: collections.abc.Mapping[str, trieste.data.Dataset], models: collections.abc.Mapping[str, trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel]) -> trieste.acquisition.function.AcquisitionFunction

      Return an acquisition function. This acquisition function is defined by first building
      acquisition functions from each of the
      :class:`~trieste.acquisition.AcquisitionFunctionBuilder`\ s specified at
      :meth:`__init__`, then reducing, with :meth:`_reduce`, the output of each of those
      acquisition functions.

      :param datasets: The data from the observer.
      :param models: The models over each dataset in ``datasets``.
      :return: The reduced acquisition function.


   .. method:: acquisitions(self) -> collections.abc.Sequence[trieste.acquisition.function.AcquisitionFunctionBuilder]
      :property:

      The acquisition function builders specified at class initialisation. 


   .. method:: _reduce(self, inputs: collections.abc.Sequence[trieste.type.TensorType]) -> trieste.type.TensorType
      :abstractmethod:

      :param inputs: The output of each constituent acquisition function.
      :return: The output of the reduced acquisition function.

   :class:`Reducer` whose resulting acquisition function returns the element-wise sum of the
   outputs of constituent acquisition functions.

   :param \*builders: Acquisition function builders. At least one must be provided.
   :raise `~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError`: If no builders are specified.

   .. method:: _reduce(self, inputs: collections.abc.Sequence[trieste.type.TensorType]) -> trieste.type.TensorType

      :param inputs: The outputs of each acquisition function.
      :return: The element-wise sum of the ``inputs``.



.. data:: AcquisitionFunction
   

   Type alias for acquisition functions.

   An :const:`AcquisitionFunction` maps a set of `B` query points (each of dimension `D`) to a single
   value that describes how useful it would be evaluate all these points together (to our goal of
   optimizing the objective function). Thus, with leading dimensions, an :const:`AcquisitionFunction`
   takes input shape `[..., B, D]` and returns shape `[..., 1]`.

   Note that :const:`AcquisitionFunction`s which do not support batch optimization still expect inputs
   with a batch dimension, i.e. an input of shape `[..., 1, D]`.


.. class:: AcquisitionFunctionBuilder

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   An :class:`AcquisitionFunctionBuilder` builds an acquisition function. 

   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, datasets: collections.abc.Mapping[str, trieste.data.Dataset], models: collections.abc.Mapping[str, trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel]) -> AcquisitionFunction
      :abstractmethod:

      :param datasets: The data from the observer.
      :param models: The models over each dataset in ``datasets``.
      :return: An acquisition function.



.. class:: BatchMonteCarloExpectedImprovement(sample_size: int, *, jitter: float = DEFAULTS.JITTER)


   Bases: :py:obj:`SingleModelAcquisitionBuilder`

   Expected improvement for batches of points (or :math:`q`-EI), approximated using Monte Carlo
   estimation with the reparametrization trick. See :cite:`Ginsbourger2010` for details.

   Improvement is measured with respect to the minimum predictive mean at observed query points.
   This is calculated in :class:`BatchMonteCarloExpectedImprovement` by assuming observations
   at new points are independent from those at known query points. This is faster, but is an
   approximation for noisy observers.

   :param sample_size: The number of samples for each batch of points.
   :param jitter: The size of the jitter to use when stabilising the Cholesky decomposition of
       the covariance matrix.
   :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``sample_size`` is not positive, or
       ``jitter`` is negative.

   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel) -> AcquisitionFunction

      :param dataset: The data from the observer. Must be populated.
      :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``. Must have event shape [1].
      :return: The batch *expected improvement* acquisition function.
      :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``dataset`` is not populated, or ``model``
          does not have an event shape of [1].



.. class:: ExpectedConstrainedImprovement(objective_tag: str, constraint_builder: AcquisitionFunctionBuilder, min_feasibility_probability: float | TensorType = 0.5)


   Bases: :py:obj:`AcquisitionFunctionBuilder`

   Builder for the *expected constrained improvement* acquisition function defined in
   :cite:`gardner14`. The acquisition function computes the expected improvement from the best
   feasible point, where feasible points are those that (probably) satisfy some constraint. Where
   there are no feasible points, this builder simply builds the constraint function.

   :param objective_tag: The tag for the objective data and model.
   :param constraint_builder: The builder for the constraint function.
   :param min_feasibility_probability: The minimum probability of feasibility for a
       "best point" to be considered feasible.
   :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``min_feasibility_probability`` is not a
       scalar in the unit interval :math:`[0, 1]`.

   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, datasets: collections.abc.Mapping[str, trieste.data.Dataset], models: collections.abc.Mapping[str, trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel]) -> AcquisitionFunction

      :param datasets: The data from the observer.
      :param models: The models over each dataset in ``datasets``.
      :return: The expected constrained improvement acquisition function. This function will raise
          :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size
          greater than one.
      :raise KeyError: If `objective_tag` is not found in ``datasets`` and ``models``.
      :raise ValueError: If the objective data is empty.



.. class:: ExpectedHypervolumeImprovement

   Bases: :py:obj:`SingleModelAcquisitionBuilder`

   Builder for the expected hypervolume improvement acquisition function.
   The implementation of the acquisition function largely
   follows :cite:`yang2019efficient`

   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel) -> AcquisitionFunction

      :param dataset: The data from the observer. Must be populated.
      :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``.
      :return: The expected hypervolume improvement acquisition function.



.. class:: ExpectedImprovement

   Bases: :py:obj:`SingleModelAcquisitionBuilder`

   Builder for the expected improvement function where the "best" value is taken to be the minimum
   of the posterior mean at observed points.

   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel) -> AcquisitionFunction

      :param dataset: The data from the observer. Must be populated.
      :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``.
      :return: The expected improvement function. This function will raise
          :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size
          greater than one.
      :raise ValueError: If ``dataset`` is empty.



.. class:: GreedyAcquisitionFunctionBuilder

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   A :class:`GreedyAcquisitionFunctionBuilder` builds an acquisition function
   suitable for greedily building batches for batch Bayesian
   Optimization. :class:`GreedyAcquisitionFunctionBuilder` differs
   from :class:`AcquisitionFunctionBuilder` by requiring that a set
   of pending points is passed to the builder. Note that this acquisition function
   is typically called `B` times each Bayesian optimization step, when building batches
   of size `B`.

   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, datasets: collections.abc.Mapping[str, trieste.data.Dataset], models: collections.abc.Mapping[str, trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel], pending_points: Optional[trieste.type.TensorType] = None) -> AcquisitionFunction
      :abstractmethod:

      :param datasets: The data from the observer.
      :param models: The models over each dataset in ``datasets``.
      :param pending_points: Points already chosen to be in the current batch (of shape [M,D]),
          where M is the number of pending points and D is the search space dimension.
      :return: An acquisition function.



.. class:: LocalPenalizationAcquisitionFunction(search_space: trieste.space.SearchSpace, num_samples: int = 500, penalizer: Callable[..., PenalizationFunction] = None, base_acquisition_function_builder: Optional[Union[ExpectedImprovement, MinValueEntropySearch]] = None)


   Bases: :py:obj:`SingleModelGreedyAcquisitionBuilder`

   Builder of the acquisition function maker for greedily collecting batches by local
   penalization.  The resulting :const:`AcquisitionFunctionMaker` takes in a set of pending
   points and returns a base acquisition function penalized around those points.
   An estimate of the objective function's Lipschitz constant is used to control the size
   of penalization.

   Local penalization allows us to perform batch Bayesian optimization with a standard (non-batch)
   acqusition function. All that we require is that the acquisition function takes strictly
   positive values. By iteratively building a batch of points though sequentially maximizing
   this acquisition function but down-weighted around locations close to the already
   chosen (pending) points, local penalization provides diverse batches of candidate points.

   Local penalization is applied to the acquisition function multiplicatively. However, to
   improve numerical stability, we perfom additive penalization in a log space.

   The Lipschitz constant and additional penalization parameters are estimated once
   when first preparing the acquisition function with no pending points. These estimates
   are reused for all subsequent function calls.

   :param search_space: The global search space over which the optimisation is defined.
   :param num_samples: Size of the random sample over which the Lipschitz constant
       is estimated. We recommend scaling this with search space dimension.
   :param penalizer: The chosen penalization method (defaults to soft penalization).
   :param base_acquisition_function_builder: Base acquisition function to be
       penalized (defaults to expected improvement). Local penalization only supports
       strictly positive acquisition functions.

   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel, pending_points: Optional[trieste.type.TensorType] = None) -> AcquisitionFunction

      :param dataset: The data from the observer.
      :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``.
      :param pending_points: The points we penalize with respect to.
      :return: The (log) expected improvement penalized with respect to the pending points.
      :raise ValueError: if the first call does not have pending_points=None.



.. class:: MinValueEntropySearch(search_space: trieste.space.SearchSpace, num_samples: int = 10, grid_size: int = 5000)


   Bases: :py:obj:`SingleModelAcquisitionBuilder`

   Builder for the max-value entropy search acquisition function modified for objective
   minimisation. :class:`MinValueEntropySearch` estimates the information in the distribution
   of the objective minimum that would be gained by evaluating the objective at a given point.

   This implementation largely follows :cite:`wang2017max` and samples the objective minimum
   :math:`y^*` via a Gumbel sampler.

   :param search_space: The global search space over which the optimisation is defined.
   :param num_samples: Number of samples to draw from the distribution over the minimum of the
       objective function.
   :param grid_size: Size of the grid with which to fit the Gumbel distribution. We recommend
       scaling this with search space dimension.

   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel) -> AcquisitionFunction

      :param dataset: The data from the observer.
      :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``.
      :return: The max-value entropy search acquisition function modified for objective
          minimisation. This function will raise :exc:`ValueError` or
          :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size greater than one.



.. class:: NegativeLowerConfidenceBound(beta: float = 1.96)


   Bases: :py:obj:`SingleModelAcquisitionBuilder`

   Builder for the negative of the lower confidence bound. The lower confidence bound is typically
   minimised, so the negative is suitable for maximisation.

   :param beta: Weighting given to the variance contribution to the lower confidence bound.
       Must not be negative.

   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel) -> AcquisitionFunction

      :param dataset: Unused.
      :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``.
      :return: The negative lower confidence bound function. This function will raise
          :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size
          greater than one.
      :raise ValueError: If ``beta`` is negative.



.. class:: NegativePredictiveMean


   Bases: :py:obj:`NegativeLowerConfidenceBound`

   Builder for the negative of the predictive mean. The predictive mean is minimised on minimising
   the objective function. The negative predictive mean is therefore maximised.

   :param beta: Weighting given to the variance contribution to the lower confidence bound.
       Must not be negative.


.. class:: ProbabilityOfFeasibility(threshold: float | TensorType)


   Bases: :py:obj:`SingleModelAcquisitionBuilder`

   Builder for the :func:`probability_of_feasibility` acquisition function, defined in
   :cite:`gardner14` as

   .. math::

       \int_{-\infty}^{\tau} p(c(\mathbf{x}) | \mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D}) \mathrm{d} c(\mathbf{x})
       \qquad ,

   where :math:`\tau` is a threshold. Values below the threshold are considered feasible by the
   constraint function. See also :cite:`schonlau1998global` for details.

   :param threshold: The (scalar) probability of feasibility threshold.
   :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``threshold`` is not a scalar.

   .. method:: threshold(self) -> float | TensorType
      :property:

      The probability of feasibility threshold. 


   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel) -> AcquisitionFunction

      :param dataset: Unused.
      :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``.
      :return: The probability of feasibility function. This function will raise
          :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size
          greater than one.



.. class:: SingleModelAcquisitionBuilder

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   Convenience acquisition function builder for an acquisition function (or component of a
   composite acquisition function) that requires only one model, dataset pair.

   .. method:: using(self, tag: str) -> AcquisitionFunctionBuilder

      :param tag: The tag for the model, dataset pair to use to build this acquisition function.
      :return: An acquisition function builder that selects the model and dataset specified by
          ``tag``, as defined in :meth:`prepare_acquisition_function`.


   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel) -> AcquisitionFunction
      :abstractmethod:

      :param dataset: The data to use to build the acquisition function.
      :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``.
      :return: An acquisition function.



.. class:: SingleModelGreedyAcquisitionBuilder

   Bases: :py:obj:`abc.ABC`

   Convenience acquisition function builder for a greedy acquisition function (or component of a
   composite greedy acquisition function) that requires only one model, dataset pair.

   .. method:: using(self, tag: str) -> GreedyAcquisitionFunctionBuilder

      :param tag: The tag for the model, dataset pair to use to build this acquisition function.
      :return: An acquisition function builder that selects the model and dataset specified by
          ``tag``, as defined in :meth:`prepare_acquisition_function`.


   .. method:: prepare_acquisition_function(self, dataset: trieste.data.Dataset, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel, pending_points: Optional[trieste.type.TensorType] = None) -> AcquisitionFunction
      :abstractmethod:

      :param dataset: The data to use to build the acquisition function.
      :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``.
      :param pending_points: Points already chosen to be in the current batch (of shape [M,D]),
          where M is the number of pending points and D is the search space dimension.
      :return: An acquisition function.



.. function:: expected_hv_improvement(model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel, pareto: trieste.utils.pareto.Pareto, reference_point: trieste.type.TensorType) -> AcquisitionFunction

   expected Hyper-volume (HV) calculating using Eq. 44 of :cite:`yang2019efficient` paper.
   The expected hypervolume improvement calculation in the non-dominated region
   can be decomposed into sub-calculations based on each partitioned cell.
   For easier calculation, this sub-calculation can be reformulated as a combination
   of two generalized expected improvements, corresponding to Psi (Eq. 44) and Nu (Eq. 45)
   function calculations, respectively.

   Note:
   1. Since in Trieste we do not assume the use of a certain non-dominated region partition
   algorithm, we do not assume the last dimension of the partitioned cell has only one
   (lower) bound (i.e., minus infinity, which is used in the :cite:`yang2019efficient` paper).
   This is not as efficient as the original paper, but is applicable to different non-dominated
   partition algorithm.
   2. As the Psi and nu function in the original paper are defined for maximization problems,
   we inverse our minimisation problem (to also be a maximisation), allowing use of the
   original notation and equations.

   :param model: The model of the objective function.
   :param pareto: Pareto class
   :param reference_point: The reference point for calculating hypervolume
   :return: The expected_hv_improvement acquisition function modified for objective
       minimisation. This function will raise :exc:`ValueError` or
       :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size greater than one.


.. function:: expected_improvement(model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel, eta: trieste.type.TensorType) -> AcquisitionFunction

   Return the Expected Improvement (EI) acquisition function for single-objective global
   optimization. Improvement is with respect to the current "best" observation ``eta``, where an
   improvement moves towards the objective function's minimum, and the expectation is calculated
   with respect to the ``model`` posterior. For model posterior :math:`f`, this is

   .. math:: x \mapsto \mathbb E \left[ \max (\eta - f(x), 0) \right]

   This function was introduced by Mockus et al, 1975. See :cite:`Jones:1998` for details.

   :param model: The model of the objective function.
   :param eta: The "best" observation.
   :return: The expected improvement function. This function will raise
       :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size
       greater than one.


.. function:: hard_local_penalizer(model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel, pending_points: trieste.type.TensorType, lipschitz_constant: trieste.type.TensorType, eta: trieste.type.TensorType) -> PenalizationFunction

   Return the hard local penalization function used for single-objective greedy batch Bayesian
   optimization in :cite:`Alvi:2019`.

   Hard penalization is a stronger penalizer than soft penalization and is sometimes more effective
   See :cite:`Alvi:2019` for details. Our implementation follows theirs, with the penalization from
   a set of pending points being the product of the individual penalizations.

   :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``.
   :param pending_points: The points we penalize with respect to.
   :param lipschitz_constant: The estimated Lipschitz constant of the objective function.
   :param eta: The estimated global minima.
   :return: The local penalization function. This function will raise
       :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size
       greater than one.


.. function:: lower_confidence_bound(model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel, beta: float) -> AcquisitionFunction

   The lower confidence bound (LCB) acquisition function for single-objective global optimization.

   .. math:: x^* \mapsto \mathbb{E} [f(x^*)|x, y] - \beta \sqrt{ \mathrm{Var}[f(x^*)|x, y] }

   See :cite:`Srinivas:2010` for details.

   :param model: The model of the objective function.
   :param beta: The weight to give to the standard deviation contribution of the LCB. Must not be
       negative.
   :return: The lower confidence bound function. This function will raise
       :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size
       greater than one.
   :raise ValueError: If ``beta`` is negative.


.. function:: min_value_entropy_search(model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel, samples: trieste.type.TensorType) -> AcquisitionFunction

   Return the max-value entropy search acquisition function (adapted from :cite:`wang2017max`),
   modified for objective minimisation. This function calculates the information gain (or change in
   entropy) in the distribution over the objective minimum :math:`y^*`, if we were to evaluate the
   objective at a given point.

   :param model: The model of the objective function.
   :param samples: Samples from the distribution over :math:`y^*`.
   :return: The max-value entropy search acquisition function modified for objective
       minimisation. This function will raise :exc:`ValueError` or
       :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size greater than one.


.. function:: probability_of_feasibility(model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel, threshold: float | TensorType) -> AcquisitionFunction

   The probability of feasibility acquisition function defined in :cite:`gardner14` as

   .. math::

       \int_{-\infty}^{\tau} p(c(\mathbf{x}) | \mathbf{x}, \mathcal{D}) \mathrm{d} c(\mathbf{x})
       \qquad ,

   where :math:`\tau` is a threshold. Values below the threshold are considered feasible by the
   constraint function.

   :param model: The model of the objective function.
   :param threshold: The (scalar) probability of feasibility threshold.
   :return: The probability of feasibility function. This function will raise
       :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size
       greater than one.
   :raise ValueError: If ``threshold`` is not a scalar.


.. function:: soft_local_penalizer(model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel, pending_points: trieste.type.TensorType, lipschitz_constant: trieste.type.TensorType, eta: trieste.type.TensorType) -> PenalizationFunction

   Return the soft local penalization function used for single-objective greedy batch Bayesian
   optimization in :cite:`Gonzalez:2016`.

   Soft penalization returns the probability that a candidate point does not belong
   in the exclusion zones of the pending points. For model posterior mean :math:`\mu`, model
   posterior variance :math:`\sigma^2`, current "best" function value :math:`\eta`, and an
   estimated Lipschitz constant :math:`L`,the penalization from a set of pending point :math:`x'`
   on a candidate point :math:`x` is given by
   .. math:: \phi(x, x') = \frac{1}{2}\textrm{erfc}(-z)
   where :math:`z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\sigma^2(x')}}(L||x'-x|| + \eta - \mu(x'))`.

   The penalization from a set of pending points is just product of the individual penalizations.
   See :cite:`Gonzalez:2016` for a full derivation.

   :param model: The model over the specified ``dataset``.
   :param pending_points: The points we penalize with respect to.
   :param lipschitz_constant: The estimated Lipschitz constant of the objective function.
   :param eta: The estimated global minima.
   :return: The local penalization function. This function will raise
       :exc:`ValueError` or :exc:`~tf.errors.InvalidArgumentError` if used with a batch size
       greater than one.


.. class:: BatchReparametrizationSampler(sample_size: int, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel)


   Bases: :py:obj:`Sampler`

   This sampler employs the *reparameterization trick* to approximate batches of samples from a
   :class:`ProbabilisticModel`\ 's predictive joint distribution as

   .. math:: x \mapsto \mu(x) + \epsilon L(x)

   where :math:`L` is the Cholesky factor s.t. :math:`LL^T` is the covariance, and
   :math:`\epsilon \sim \mathcal N (0, 1)` is constant for a given sampler, thus ensuring samples
   form a continuous curve.

   :param sample_size: The number of samples for each batch of points. Must be positive.
   :param model: The model to sample from.
   :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``sample_size`` is not positive.

   .. method:: sample(self, at: trieste.type.TensorType, *, jitter: float = DEFAULTS.JITTER) -> trieste.type.TensorType

      Return approximate samples from the `model` specified at :meth:`__init__`. Multiple calls to
      :meth:`sample`, for any given :class:`BatchReparametrizationSampler` and ``at``, will
      produce the exact same samples. Calls to :meth:`sample` on *different*
      :class:`BatchReparametrizationSampler` instances will produce different samples.

      :param at: Batches of query points at which to sample the predictive distribution, with
          shape `[..., B, D]`, for batches of size `B` of points of dimension `D`. Must have a
          consistent batch size across all calls to :meth:`sample` for any given
          :class:`BatchReparametrizationSampler`.
      :param jitter: The size of the jitter to use when stabilising the Cholesky decomposition of
          the covariance matrix.
      :return: The samples, of shape `[..., S, B, L]`, where `S` is the `sample_size`, `B` the
          number of points per batch, and `L` the dimension of the model's predictive
          distribution.
      :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If any of the following are true:

          - ``at`` is a scalar.
          - The batch size `B` of ``at`` is not positive.
          - The batch size `B` of ``at`` differs from that of previous calls.
          - ``jitter`` is negative.



.. class:: DiscreteThompsonSampler(sample_size: int, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel)


   Bases: :py:obj:`Sampler`

   This sampler provides approximate Thompson samples of the objective function's
   maximiser :math:`x^*` over a discrete set of input locations.

   :param sample_size: The desired number of samples.
   :param model: The model to sample from.
   :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``sample_size`` is not positive.

   .. method:: sample(self, at: trieste.type.TensorType) -> trieste.type.TensorType

      Return approximate samples from of the objective function's minimser. We return only
      unique samples.

      :param at: Where to sample the predictive distribution, with shape `[N, D]`, for points
          of dimension `D`.
      :return: The samples, of shape `[S, D]`, where `S` is the `sample_size`.
      :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``at`` has an invalid shape.



.. class:: GumbelSampler(sample_size: int, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel)


   Bases: :py:obj:`Sampler`

   This sampler follows :cite:`wang2017max` and yields approximate samples of the objective
   minimum value :math:`y^*` via the empirical cdf :math:`\operatorname{Pr}(y^*<y)`. The cdf
   is approximated by a Gumbel distribution

   .. math:: \mathcal G(y; a, b) = 1 - e^{-e^\frac{y - a}{b}}

   where :math:`a, b \in \mathbb R` are chosen such that the quartiles of the Gumbel and cdf match.
   Samples are obtained via the Gumbel distribution by sampling :math:`r` uniformly from
   :math:`[0, 1]` and applying the inverse probability integral transform
   :math:`y = \mathcal G^{-1}(r; a, b)`.

   :param sample_size: The desired number of samples.
   :param model: The model to sample from.
   :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``sample_size`` is not positive.

   .. method:: sample(self, at: trieste.type.TensorType) -> trieste.type.TensorType

      Return approximate samples from of the objective function's minimum value.

      :param at: Points at where to fit the Gumbel distribution, with shape `[N, D]`, for points
          of dimension `D`. We recommend scaling `N` with search space dimension.
      :return: The samples, of shape `[S, 1]`, where `S` is the `sample_size`.
      :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``at`` has an invalid shape.



.. class:: IndependentReparametrizationSampler(sample_size: int, model: trieste.models.ProbabilisticModel)


   Bases: :py:obj:`Sampler`

   This sampler employs the *reparameterization trick* to approximate samples from a
   :class:`ProbabilisticModel`\ 's predictive distribution as

   .. math:: x \mapsto \mu(x) + \epsilon \sigma(x)

   where :math:`\epsilon \sim \mathcal N (0, 1)` is constant for a given sampler, thus ensuring
   samples form a continuous curve.

   :param sample_size: The number of samples to take at each point. Must be positive.
   :param model: The model to sample from.
   :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``sample_size`` is not positive.

   .. method:: sample(self, at: trieste.type.TensorType) -> trieste.type.TensorType

      Return approximate samples from the `model` specified at :meth:`__init__`. Multiple calls to
      :meth:`sample`, for any given :class:`IndependentReparametrizationSampler` and ``at``, will
      produce the exact same samples. Calls to :meth:`sample` on *different*
      :class:`IndependentReparametrizationSampler` instances will produce different samples.

      :param at: Where to sample the predictive distribution, with shape `[..., 1, D]`, for points
          of dimension `D`.
      :return: The samples, of shape `[..., S, 1, L]`, where `S` is the `sample_size` and `L` is
          the number of latent model dimensions.
      :raise ValueError (or InvalidArgumentError): If ``at`` has an invalid shape.
